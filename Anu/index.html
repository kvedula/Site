                Where do I start. I have known you for a pretty long time now, almost 3 years I think. Haha let's just say its been a wild ride since then. I was an idiot back then and you know I still am :P, but I'm not the creep I was back then anymore(I think). LOL jk. I know I'm not. Ever since the day I met you, you have had a special place in my life. I was the weirdo trying to get you to like me back then and successfully failed at it. I made you get annoyed at me countless times and I still might, but you have to deal with it now. I'm so glad that we somehow got so close in the last year that even I am still surprised as to how it happened. I am so lucky to have met you and even though we got off with a rough start I am so happy that we are where we are right now.

                You are one of the most perfect people I know. You are cultured, you are talented, smart, sweet, kind, caring, loving, giving, helpful, beautiful, cute, hot ;) , and above all you are my pandhi and I love you so much words can't describe how much I do. I am so lucky to have you as a friend and as a girlfriend and I'm so lucky and glad to be able to call you mine. You always have a way of making me laugh(when you're high), you can always turn my frown upside down in the matter of seconds, you are always there for me night or day, rain or shine, you are the one person I can count on to be there for me even when everyone else might not be there to help. You've also found some way to make me so much better than I was before. As long as you are by my side, I know I will be an amazing person. We grew so close over the past 3 years and I can't wait to spend many more years with you. 
              </p>

                Sorry Pandhi, but you're stuck with me for a long, long, long time. You are the one that I wake up and say good morning to and the one that I say goodnight to before sleeping and the one person that I am always thinking about. You mean so much to me Pandhi. I love you so much babe. I hope you have the best day possible because you deserve it. I'm glad to have you in my life and even more glad to be able to call you my girlfriend. Sadly I can't give you your kisses right now, but next time I see you, you better brace for the tightest hug possible and the best kisses ever. ;)
