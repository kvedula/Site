    <div class="docs-content">
      <h2> Getting Started</h2>
      <h3 id="welcome"> Syllabus</h3>
      <p> This course covers concepts and details related to programming in C++.</p>
      
      <h4>Lecture</h4>

      <p> Attending lecture and participating in lecture is required. 
      I will not repeat lecture material in office hours or on the discussion forum. 
      Lecture is your one chance to experience the new material. 
      I do not allow recording of any lectures. </p>

      <h4>Discussion Form</h4>
      
      <p>Students should expect to spend significant time writing and debugging programs related to the homework assignments. 
      I recommend students schedule three to four 4-hour blocks per week to work on homework programs.
      All students are expected to read and post on the class on-line discussion forum.
      You can sign up here Piazza <a href="http://piazza.com/uci/fall2017/ics45c" target="_blank">Sign-up</a>.</p>

      <p>If you have a question about homework or course material, do not email it to the the instructor or the TAs. 
      Instead, post your questions to Piazza. This allows everyone in the class a chance to answer it first, so you are likely to get a very quick answer. 
      The instructor and TAs will also read Piazza and may answer there, but everyone will be able to see the question and answer which reduces duplicate questions.
      If you have a personal issue or want to discuss your homework or quiz score, come see your instructor or TA during office hours or 
      email them if you can’t make office hours.</p>

      <p>Helping other students learn is encouraged. Most interesting stuff happens in Q&amp;A. 
      You may post small program fragments on Piazza related to your question or your answer, 
      but please do not post answers to homework problems anywhere.</p>

      <p>I only answer primary questions on Piazza. I generally do not answer follow-up questions. Students and TAs: 
      please do answer questions on Piazza if you know the answer.</p>

      <h4>Textbook</h4>

      <p>Students should have access to one good C++ programming textbook. Absolute C++ by Savitch is recommended (<a href="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/j141tt2hk17484/ixjr19rg5h925s/j1741tpcs6hu/Savitch_Absolute_Cpp_1st_Ed_free.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>), 
      but there are many good C++ books that may be used as alternatives. ecture notes, homework assignments, and a discussion forum will be provided on-line.</p>

      <h4>Computing Platform (operating system, editor, compiler, debugger)</h4>

      <p>We use openlab.ics.uci.edu computers for testing your programs. These computers use the Linux operating system and the command processor is called bash. 
      If you have never logged into the ICS machines before, you may need to authorize your account first <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php" target="_blank">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php</a>.</p>

      <p>You can <a href="https://swiki.ics.uci.edu/doku.php/accounts:ssh_keys" target="_blank">set up ssh keys</a> or use vpn with ssh to connect to openlab computers from off campus.</p>

      <p>You can develop your programs on these computers using g++ compiler. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ixkx1elCOKUW-Kt7aB1EQ4Jr_dp6G_QDb6xNYckDA6k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> 
      is how to log into and use the C++ compiler on our openlab computers. You can set-up a password reset <a href="https://support.ics.uci.edu/ltb" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Here is a note from our computing support staff for how to setup your account to use g++, gdb, and valgrind. Our homework 0 also has you do this.</p>

      <p>If you accidentally delete your files, you can recover them yourself <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/services/snapshot.php" target="_blank">read about it here</a>. If you just want a fresh start with your .bash_profile, you can copy a new copy with cp</p>

      <pre class="prettyprint"> cp     /opt/local/etc/skel/example.bashrc    ~/.bashrc </pre>

      <p>If putty logs you out, look at the Keepalive values in Settings under Connection. Set them to longer to keep you alive longer while you are idle.
      <a href="http://subin.me/blog/how-to-avoid-ssh-session-timeout-in-putty/" target="_blank">Here is how to</a> disable timeout on PuTTY - the 
      annoying way it disconnects you if you let it sit idle for too long.</p>
        
      <p>You may use other C++ compilers (e.g., xcode on Mac, visual Studio on Windows, or gcc/g++ on Linux but I strongly encourage you to use g++ on openlab.ics.uci.edu as that is the only platform where we will provide help.   You can find excellent cheat-sheets or tutorials on-line using Google.  Example searches include “vim command summary” and “linux command summary”  if you want to find quick reference sheets. 
      </p>
          
      <p><a href="http://www.radford.edu/~mhtay/CPSC120/VIM_Editor_Commands.htm" target = "_blank">Here is one for vim that just gives basic commands.</a></p> 
      
      <p><a href="ftp://ftp.psu.ac.th/pub/bash-howto/reference_bash-cheat.pdf" target="_blank">Here is one for linux bash commands.</a> </p>
        
      <p><a href="http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/PG1-13/bash.quickref.pdf" target="_blank">Here is one for bash scripts.</a></p> 
        
      <p><a href="http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/" target="_blank">Make tutorial.</a> </p>  
        
      <p>Valgrind is a valuable tool for detecting run-time errors with your C++ program. You can run it on Linux (to get basic checking) with the following command 
      </p>
          
      <pre class="prettyprint">valgrind program_name program_arguments</pre>

      <p>or to get very careful checking</p>
        
      <pre class="prettyprint">valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes --show-reachable=yes --track-origins=yes 
program_name program_arguments
      </pre>
        
      <p>You can use scp or ftp to transfer files between computers (like openlab and your laptop).</p>
        
      <p>If your only programming language experience is in Python, I suggest you read this tutorial on C++ arrays <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/" target="_blank">Tutorial</a>. There are many videos on C++ such as this one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rub-JsjMhWY" target="_blank">Learn C++ Video</a>. Generally, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/" target="_blank">this site</a> is useaful and where you should start when you want some help from the Internet.  Don’t waste your time on stackoverflow.com.
      </p> 
        
      <h4>No Group Work!</h4>  
        
      <p>All work is to be completed individually. There is no group work or group collaboration allowed in this course.  Discussing concepts with others at a high level is encouraged, but it <b>is cheating to work on homework programs together, or to copy parts or all of your programs from any source including another student  (current or previous), or from the Internet, or from a book</b>. We will use MOSS to check for cheating on homework submissions.  Anyone whose homework is flagged as a copy will receive a zero for that homework submission.  Guard your programs and do not share them with anyone.</p>
        
      <h4>Cheating</h4>
        
      <p>Familiarize yourself with UCI Academic Integrity Policy <a href="http://honesty.uci.edu/" target="_blank">http://honesty.uci.edu/</a> Anyone caught cheating in this class will be submitted to the University for prosecution and if found guilty, will receive a course grade of F. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/Academic_Honesty.php" target="_blank">Here are some important examples of violations.</a> <b>DO NOT POST SOLUTIONS TO ANY ASSIGNMENTS ON-LINE - especially on github.  This is facilitating cheating which is very serious form of cheating.  Posting homework solutions on-line ruins the homework.  Homework is where students learn.  If they see (or worse use) a solution, that ruins their chance to learn from that assignment.</b>
      </p>
        
      <h4>Homeworks (HW)</h4>
        
      <p>Homeworks are due one week after assigned.  Homework is due before 8am on Wednesday.    You may submit homework up to 24 hours late (until 8am Thursday) for a 10 point penalty.  You may submit homework up to 48 hours late (until 8am Friday) for a 20 point penalty.  HW1 is due before 8am Wednesday of Week 2.  HW0 is important set-up and practice, but there is nothing to submit.  Do it as soon as you can before the end of Week 1.
      </p>
        
      <p><b>Never copy and paste code when you are learning a new language.  Writing/typing all of it is a valuable experience and there is no short cut for it.</b></p>
        
      <h4>Submitting your Homework Report</h4>
      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/document/d/1rp3-oBsKPFDFC3IWcL3zYHRIJYS_aTgfG1hq0O3PXD0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> is how you submit your homework assignments</p>
      
      <p>It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission is what you intend to submit.  Every term we have students who submit the wrong file.  We will no longer allow you to resubmit at a later time without penalty if you submit the wrong files. You should verify that what you sumitted is correct.  You may submit multiple times, but only your last submission will be graded and the time of that last submission will be used to determine when it was submitted for on-time or late credit.</p>
        
      <h4 id="tutor">TA Office Hours and Tutor Hours (shared with ICS2 100)</h4> 
      
      <p>TA Thejdeep has office hours in ICS 424E
      <br>Monday's : 2PM - 4PM
      <br>Tuesday's : 2:30PM - 4:30PM
      <br><em>Tutors have office hours in ICS2 100</em>
      </p>
        
      <p><b>Quizzes (Q)</b> will be given weekly in lecture (usually on Thursdays at the end of lecture) as scheduled above.  Quiz coverage is the homeworks and lectures since the previous quiz.  Quiz 1 will be given Thursday of Week 2 at the end of lecture.  Quiz 0 is a practice quiz to give you a sample of what a quiz will be like.  I suggest you practice by printing it, then doing it at home with a 15 minute timer. Also, each week when you start on your homework, write your entire first draft of each program on paper while tryig to get the logic and syntax correct.  Enter what you wrote, then see the errors as the compiler tells you about them.  Note what mistakes you made and correct them.</p>
        
      <p>You must bring valid picture ID with you to all quizzes.  We will check everyone’s ID during the final quiz.  Anyone without a valid picture ID will be photographed during the quiz and must bring a valid photo ID to office hours to get credit for the final quiz. I prefer a valid drivers license, but a UCI student ID that is clearly readable is also acceptable.  If your UCI ID is faded so that any of these three - ID number, name, or picture - is not clearly readable, it is not acceptable for ID verification.</p>
        
      <p>There are no make-ups on regular quizzes unless you are seriously ill and under care of a doctor. You must provide official, dated documentation from your doctor saying you are too ill to take the exam on the day it is given. I do allow quiz make-up for those attending the Grace Hopper conference with proof of attendance, but the quiz must be made-up the following week in my office hours.</p>  
        
      <p>There are no make-ups on the final quiz.</p>  
        
      <p><b>Regrades:</b> If you have any issue with grading of your homework or quiz, you must contest it within one week of the grade being posted to the EEE gradebook.  The only issue for regrade are clear mistakes in grading where a correct answer was mistakenly marked wrong (this does happen) or where points were incorrectly totalled (this is more rare). </p> 
      
      <p>You may contest your homework grade by emailing the TA. </p>  
        
      <p>You may come view your graded quizzes in the instructor’s office during scheduled office hours. If you suspect a grading issue, you may raise that issue at that time.</p>
        
      <p>There is no re-grading after 10th week.  Note also, I never second guess the TA’s grading and amount of points deducted for a given error.</p>    
        
      <h4>Course Grades</h4> 
      <p>Quizzes 1-7 (lowest dropped): 40%</p>
      <p>Homeworks (9): 40%</p>
      <p>Final: 20%</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Q(40%) + H(40%) + F(20%) = Total(100%)</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>Course letter grades will be assigned by the default straight scale in the EEE gradebook.
      <br>Out of 100% scale:
      </p>
        
      <ul>
        <li>A+ ≥  97.5  > A ≥  93.5  > A- ≥  90</li>
        <li>B+ ≥  86.5  > B ≥  83.5  > B- ≥  80</li>
        <li>C+ ≥  76.5  > C ≥  73.5  > C- ≥  70</li> 
        <li>D+ ≥  66.5  > D ≥  63.5  > D- ≥  60  > F</li> 
      </ul>
        
      <b><p>IMPORTANT: There is no other extra credit in this course.  The university only allows grade adjustments for grading errors on our part.  Please do not ask us to allow you to do "anything" to improve your course grade after it is calcuated.  By asking for such special accomodations, you are putting us in a very difficult position.  All such requests will be ignored or pointed back to this note.  The time to think about doing "anything" is during the course when you can make changes like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>attending lecture faithfully and on time, reading assigned reading before lecture</li>
        <li>paying attention in lecture and taking notes on things you don't already know</li>
        <li>ask questions when you don’t understand</li>
        <li>studying more effectively before exams (like asking yourself hypothetical questions)</li>
        <li>reading exam questions very carefully and giving clear, correct answers</li>
        <li>starting homework &amp; other assignments early and ensuring they are completed on time or early</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="advice">Advice to Students</h3>
      <p><b>You are paying for a chance at an education, not a degree.</b> Learning is investing in yourself to make yourself more enlightened and valuable.  What makes you valuable in the marketplace are: <b>Knowledge</b> (what you know), <b>skills</b> (what you can do), <b>connections</b> (who you know and how they view you), and <b>accomplishments</b> (what you have done of value).  Focus on building these four attributes and record them on your resume. Also, always keep an up-to-date resume and add to it as you develop yourself.</p>
        
      <p><b>You can get a great education at this university.</b>  You can also get a poor education at any university.  No one can teach you.  Only you can teach yourself.  It is mostly up to you what you get out of the opportunity.  Just like physical exercise, you get out of it what you put into it.  Select courses that will build the four attributes listed above.  Focus on learning as much as you can - not only on passing the course. You also want to give yourself time to build <b>connections</b> which may mean joining student organizations, playing sports, and socializing with other students.

      <p><b>Take a light load your first term at the univeristy. </b> A light load might be three “real” courses.  You have a lot to adjust to - a new living situation, making new friends, learning your way around, developing good habits - so adding too heavy of a course workload your first term could overwhelm you.  After that first term, you have a better idea of how much workload you can handle.  You can add another course and see how it goes. Also remember, ICS does not allow dropping classes after the second week, so you are “stuck” once you pass that week.  Note this applies to transfer students as well as to Freshman.</p>
        
      <p><b>Always go to lecture and pay attention.</b> It is the main thing you are paying for when you go to a university.  No one can multi-task their attention.  If you are looking at your phone or computer, you can’t be paying attention to lecture.  Showing up and not paying attention is little better than not showing up at all.  Here are just a few relevant quotes
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>“80 percent of success is just showing up” Woodie Allen from Love &amp; Death.</li>
        <li>“Most of life is showing up. You do the best you can, which varies from day to day.” Regina Brett</li>
        <li>“Showing up every day isn't enough. There are a lot of guys who show up every day who shouldn't have showed up at all.” James Caan</li>
        <li>“Showing up is not all of life - but it counts for a lot.” Hillary Clinton</li>
        <li>“I feel strongly about showing up and being prepared and not taking the opportunity for granted and being conscientious about my fellow co-workers.” Paul Schneider</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p><b>Take notes on paper with pencil/pen.</b> Read <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/" target="_blank">this article</a> or <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/take-notes-by-hand-for-better-long-term-comprehension.html#.WGfwdtArLC0" target="_blank">this</a>.  Lecture is not like watching a video.  It is an interactive learning session: the instructor is the guide and each student is actively understanding and integrating the knowledge.</p>
        
      <p><b>Read everything with understanding - your textbook, the lecture notes, your homework assignments, and your test questions.</b> The more advanced you get, the more you must learn by reading.  Develop good reading habits early rather than later.  Too often, I see students get zero for their answer by mis-reading or mis-understanding a written question.  I also see many students ask questions on the discussion forum that are answered directly in the syllabus or homework assignment.  Either they did not read it or they did not understand it.</p>
        
      <p><b>Knowledge and skill must be in your brain to be yours.</b> What is on the Internet or in a textbook is not your knowledge until you make it yours.  Knowledge must be in your working memory for you to be able to use it.</p>
        
      <p><b>The Internet is just one resource and it is not your brain.</b>  The Internet is full of good information, but it is more full of garbage.  Developing a good foundation is valuable to help you wade through the garbage to find the valuable stuff.  When you do work, you need a certain amount of knowledge and skills in your brain to work with.  To some extent, you must also know “what you don’t know” so you can do further research to find out the details that you may have forgotten.</p>
        
      <p><b>When you start to learn something new, start with Wikipedia.</b> If it involves doing something, look on YouTube to see if there are any good videos.  I find reading much faster for learning than videos, but it may be different for you.  If I must watch a video, I bump the speed to 2X and that works well for most videos.  Expect to spend a big part of your time reading whenever you are working on a project.  Most of what you will learn after school will be through reading and doing.</p>
    
      <p><b>Learn to manage your time.</b>  Construct a 7-day weekly schedule for each term with everything on it - including sleep, work time, commute time, lectures, labs, discussions, study time, eating time, and play time.  You will be surprised how little “free” time you have. Here is a good place to start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management</a>. I use Google calendar.</p>
        
      <p><b>Start early on any programming assignment.</b> They always take more time than you expect.  Get used to it.  It is the nature of software/hardware/system development.  Also, a few large blocks of contiguous time are better than many small blocks.  I like 4 hour blocks of time for programming.   Take breaks when you run into a tough problem or when you get tired.  Try to schedule your homework time slots at the time of day your brain works best.</p>
        
      <p><b>When doing group (pair) work, be sure you understand and contribute.</b>  Coasting on the coat-tails of partners will catch up with you and you will get too far behind in knowledge/skill to ever catch up.  Also don’t let your partner rob you of your chance to learn and contribute.  Finally, don’t divide up the work so you do what you’re good at and your partner does what they are good at.  You are just avoiding strengthening your weaknesses.  Instead, focus on eliminating your weaknesses.  Remember to make connections.  Partners from class are a good place to start.</p>
        
      <p><b>Attempt and complete each homework assignment.</b> You learn by doing, not by listening or watching.  Each homework problem is your chance to learn a lesson your teacher believes is important for your development.  Seeing the solution is not the same as learning.  You must attempt and complete the homework to learn the material covered by that homework assignment.  If you see a solution before solving it yourself, I believe you must then solve a similar problem yourself to learn the lesson.  Sadly, teachers often can’t provide you with multiple versions of each homework assignment.</p>
        
      <p><b>If you do poorly on a homework or a test, change how you are working on it.</b>  Some students keep doing the same thing even if it is not working well for them.  Come on, you’re smarter than that.  If it isn’t working, think about making positive changes.</p>
        
      <b><p>Tips to success in University courses.</p></b>
      <ul>
        <li>attend lecture faithfully and on time, read assigned reading before lecture</li> 
        <li>pay attention in lecture and take written notes on things you don't already know</li>
        <li>ask questions (in lecture, class forum, or office hours) when you don’t understand</li>
        <li>start early on homework &amp; other assignments and ensure they are completed early</li>
        <li>study more effectively before exams (like asking yourself hypothetical questions)</li>
        <li>read exam questions very carefully and give clear, correct answers</li>
        <li>review graded homeworks and exams and understand and learn anything you missed</li>
      </ul>
